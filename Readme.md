# Tracking Deployment Frequency with Datadog, SecRel Pipeline, and Custom Dashboards

This document outlines the steps to monitor deployment frequency, success rates, and the time taken from image push to Kubernetes deployment using Datadog, integrated with a SecRel pipeline.

## Outline
1. SecRel Pipeline – Custom Metrics in Datadog
2. Scan Data Already in Datadog Related to Deployments
3. Create Custom Dashboard
    - Tracking Time: Image Push to Kubernetes Deployment
    - Monitoring Deployment Success/Failure
    - Tracking Deployment Frequency

## 1. SecRel Pipeline – Custom Metrics in Datadog

The **SecRel pipeline** is instrumental in ensuring tenant compliance before deployment. By embedding custom metrics into the pipeline, we can gather insights about deployment timings and events.

### Implementation:
- **Add Custom Metrics**: Log significant pipeline events such as:
  - When an image is pushed to the registry
  - Start and completion times of security scans
  - Successful deployments to Kubernetes
- **Datadog Integration**: Use Datadog’s API or native integration to send logs and metrics from the pipeline to Datadog.

## 2. Scan Data Already in Datadog Related to Deployments
Before building new tools, leverage the existing data in Datadog to analyze deployment patterns and trends. This data includes logs and metrics that Datadog collects from Kubernetes and CI/CD tools.
## Steps:
- **Query Deployment Data**: Use Datadog's log management tools to search for events related to deployments. This can include container start events, kubectl apply commands, and CI/CD pipeline triggers.
- **Analyze Trends**: Create visualizations to identify:
  - Common bottlenecks during deployments
  - Patterns of successful vs. failed deployments
  
## 3. Create Custom Dashboard
After gathering the necessary data, create a custom dashboard in Datadog to visualize deployment metrics. This dashboard should include three key components

1. Tracking Time: Image Push to Kubernetes Deployment
2. Monitoring Deployment Success/Failure
3. Tracking Deployment Frequency
